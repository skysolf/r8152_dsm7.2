# Patched for DSM 7.2 Support

Thanks for [almir1904](https://github.com/almir1904) and [peterywong](https://github.com/peterywong)

Only two platform drivers are listed here(ds920+-->geminilake,ds918+ -->apollolake), if your platform is not in the list, you can refer to the  [almir1904](https://github.com/almir1904) command to compile it yourself.

If you don't know your platform,view this page [What kind of CPU does my Synology NAS have?](https://kb.synology.com/en-me/DSM/tutorial/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have)


`mkdir -p /toolkit`

`apt-get install cifs-utils python3 python3-pip git`

`git clone https://github.com/SynologyOpenSource/pkgscripts-ng`

`cd /toolkit/pkgscripts-ng/`

`git checkout DSM7.2`

`./EnvDeploy -v 7.2 -p geminilake (replace it with your CPU GEN)`

`mkdir source`

`cd source/`

`git clone https://github.com/bb-qq/r8152.git`

`cd /toolkit/pkgscripts-ng/`

`./PkgCreate.py -v 7.2 -p geminilake -c r8152`


Run sudo install -m 4755 -o root -D /var/packages/r8152/target/r8152/spk_su /opt/sbin/spk_su

# DSM driver for realtek RTL8152/RTL8153/RTL8156 based USB Ethernet adapters

This is a RTL8152/RTL8153/RTL8156(2.5Gbps or 1.0Gbps) driver package for Synology NASes.

You may also be interested in my another project [AQC111U(5Gbps) driver package for Synology NASes](https://github.com/bb-qq/aqc111).

## Supported NAS platform

* DSM 7.x
* apollolake based products
    * DS918+ (confirmed working)
    * DS620slim
    * DS1019+
    * DS718+
    * DS418play
    * DS218+

You can download drivers including other platforms from the [release page](https://github.com/bb-qq/r8152/releases) and determine a proper driver for your model from [knowledge base of Synology](https://www.synology.com/en-global/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/Compatibility_Peripherals/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have), but you might encounter some issues with unconfirmed platforms. If you are using such an unconfirmed models, the [Compatibility page](https://github.com/bb-qq/r8152/wiki/Compatibility) may be helpful.

I very much appreciate if you report whether it works. If you have any problems, the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/bb-qq/r8152/wiki/Troubleshooting) page may help.

***NOTE***: I recommend using front ports to connect devices because some users reported stability issues when they use rear ports.

## Supported RTL8156(2.5Gbps) based devices

* [ASUSTOR AS-U2.5G](https://amzn.to/2ZRx1pi) (Type-C)
  * NOTE: The included Type A-C conversion adapter is directional. There's a mark on one side of the USB-C connector that must be on the same side as the USB logo on the adapter.
* [Plannex USB-LAN2500R](https://amzn.to/2ZISyAb) (Type-A, Japan only)
* [Buffalo LUA-U3-A2G](https://amzn.to/36kGQf9) (Type-A, Japan only)
* [CLUB 3D CAC-1420](https://amzn.to/2ZPmzKD) (Type-A,)
* [TRENDnet TUC-ET2G](https://amzn.to/2PLmR5v) (Type-C)
* [CableCreation 2.5G Ethernet to USB Adapter](https://amzn.to/39yfZyj) (Type-A)
* [UGREEN USB C to 2.5G Ethernet Adapter](https://amzn.to/3fzXmfE) (Type-C)
* biaze KZ13 (Type-A, confirmed working)

See the [Compatibility page](https://github.com/bb-qq/r8152/wiki/Compatibility) for the latest information.
If you got other products not listed and they do not work, please create a issue with the output of lsusb.

## How to install

### Preparation

[Enable SSH](https://www.synology.com/en-us/knowledgebase/DSM/tutorial/General_Setup/How_to_login_to_DSM_with_root_permission_via_SSH_Telnet) and login your NAS.

### Installation

1. Go to "Package Center"
2. Press "Manual Install"
3. Chose a driver package downloaded from the [release page](https://github.com/bb-qq/r8152/releases).
4. [DSM7] The installation will fail the first time. After that, run the following command from the SSH terminal:
   `sudo install -m 4755 -o root -D /var/packages/r8152/target/r8152/spk_su /opt/sbin/spk_su`
5. [DSM7] Retry installation. (You don't need above DSM7 specific steps at the next time.)

*Warning*: Do not use Safari for this operation.

## How to configure

You can configure the IP addresses and MTU of the added NICs from the DSM UI in the same way as the built-in NICs.

Option: I recommend setting MTU to 9000 and SMB protocol version to v3 for better performance.

## Performance test

### Environment
* DS918+ (USB-LAN2500R)
* DSM 6.2
* direct connection with PC (AQN-107: discontinued, but almost equivalent to [ASUS XG-C100C](https://amzn.to/3fPJUX3))
* [native iperf3](http://www.jadahl.com/iperf-arp-scan/DSM_6.2/)
    * using docker causes high CPU load
